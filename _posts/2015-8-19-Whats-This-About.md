title: What's This About?
---

__TL;DR__ - I made a github blog out of Jeykll ([using this guide]{http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/}) to talk about things related to web development. Mostly, I tend to find that things on the internet aren't explained to my liking, so this blog is for my explanations or experiences, which may or may not help others.

## How I Came to the Web
I was introduced to the web in 1995, and I made my first web site that summer. I learned Java in 1997 (when it was a thing that people thought would be all over the Web), and I made applets for a bit. I learned JavaScript at some point in the late 90s, then PHP and MySQL in 2000, then Flash in 2002. For years, I was a Flash programmer - I know, that destroys my credibility. Eventually, Flash died, and I focused on JavaScript from then until now.

## Why I'm Doing the Blog
I've mentored a lot of coders in the last 20 years, and I find that lots of things that are out there on the web fall short of the kind of good explanations that help people understand solutions. StackOverflow is great, but rarely are the answers comprehensive in why they work. So... I guess I want to fix that?

## In Conclusion
That's it. Post concluded!
